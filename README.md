## first steps with FLASK
# WHAT  
### I had not done much Python since taking a (great) data science intro class in late 2018. 
### I had worked with JavaScript React, Node and Express for my General Assembly bootcamp projects, and I was looking for ways to practice python. 
### I also wanted to start using Flask, as well as get comfortable with virtualenv 
### SO I followed step by step this useful tutorial: hhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo&list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH&t=217s
